                    <p>When I was in high school, I had a rebellious phase where I didn't take too many regular pictures of myself!</p>

                    <p>When I was in high school, I did track and field. My senior year of high school track, I made it to States. I competed with the other top shotputters in Massachusetts. In this competition, I came in fifth! Check out the records below:</p>

                    <p>In college, I went to many Syracuse University sporting events. Because I went to so many events, I was able to take pictures with Otto the Orange, Syracuse University's mascot.</p>

                    <p>Hello, my name is Tracy Isman and I am web development student at Startup Institute Summer 2016. This is my foray into making a website. I have two brothers, each with their own wife. Each brother now has one child, so I have one nephew and one niece. I grew up in Newton, did track at Newton North High School, went to Syracuse University where I was a member of the Syracuse University Marching Band (SUMB) and a fan of all Syracuse sports. After graduating from Syracuse, I taught high school math for four years. Two years into my teaching, I was given the Advanced Programming course, which taught in Java. I taught that for two years, and that is where I discovered that I liked, and was pretty good at, programming.</p>
